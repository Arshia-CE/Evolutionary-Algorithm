# Evolutionary-Algorithm
# Evolutionary Strategy Algorithm Co-Design Project

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to gain practical familiarity with the co-design process of hardware and software by implementing a practical example at the system level. The Evolutionary Strategy (ES) algorithm, a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, is chosen for co-designing both hardware and software components.

## Algorithm Description

Evolutionary Strategies Algorithm is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by natural selection. It aims to find suitable solutions within a specific time frame, making it a good choice for various engineering applications, including embedded systems. Despite its simplicity, implementing it in embedded systems presents challenges due to inherent constraints.

## Modular Design

The modular design of the algorithm and its distribution among hardware and software processing components is emphasized for improving performance and deployment in embedded systems. The decision of allocating each module to hardware or software is made based on problem requirements and system considerations.

## Implementation Process

The implementation involves generating an initial population of candidate solutions, applying changes through iterations to guide the population towards the optimal solution. Recombination and mutation operations are performed to create diversity in the population. The termination condition is adjusted based on criteria such as the number of iterations or achieving a sufficiently good answer.

## Project Requirements

To undertake this project, you need to master the ES algorithm, specify main modules and system processes for hardware and software implementation, and establish proper communication between them using SystemC. The goal is to achieve effective parallelization during implementation.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the correctness of the implemented structure by solving a benchmark problem. Set termination conditions appropriately and present the results along with the implementation codes.

### Benchmark Problem: Knapsack Problem

Consider solving the Knapsack Problem using the ES algorithm. Given candidate items with their prices and weights, find the optimal combination for maximum profit, considering the possibility of taking a percentage of each item.

## Optional Section

Implement the software part of the system in the Matlab design environment. Compare the performance of the system with the previously implemented structure in SystemC.

## Usage

Follow the provided guidelines for generating an initial population, setting termination conditions, and adjusting parameters like population size, recombination probability, and mutation.

## Conclusion

This co-design project aims to implement the ES algorithm efficiently in both hardware and software components, creating a system suitable for various optimization problems in embedded systems.
